      <h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Usability is a part of the software engineering area and is a known topic in the application development process. Some people see the usability as a cost, some others see it as an investment. In an educational game development process, usability should not be used as a marketing tool. It is an indispensable inclusion instrument. However, depending on the use, it may be converted as an exclusion tool.</p>
<p>The early discussions about usability emerged when computers were used by a small number of people. The activities were really tough, and the software was not considered an important part of a computer. Video games were the first software that brought the approach of pleasant and user-friendly interfaces. Currently, the game players’ demands are still responsible to force the technological advance.</p>
<h2 id="Games-in-Education"><a href="#Games-in-Education" class="headerlink" title="Games in Education"></a>Games in Education</h2><p>Playing a game is an essentially funny activity, to entertain and relax. However, games can be more than a fun activity. Called serious games, these products are games in which education is the primary goal, rather than entertainment (Michael and Chen, 2006, p. 17).</p>
<p>Educational games are being developed to help teach any topic, from history to math, science or languages. When they combine good game design with strong educational content, they are converted into an excellent learning tool. It gives an opportunity of learning to students who are not connected with their school activities (McGonigal, 2011, p. 128).</p>
<p>Learn with games can be an excellent alternative to the boring classroom. Games are puzzles to solve, just like everything else we encounter in life, and the fun is all about our brains feeling good (Koster, 2005, p. 36-40). Combined with the internet, serious games offer a significant opportunity for educators. They are an effective teaching tool that helps teachers to integrate the activities into the classroom (Michael and Chen, 2006, p. 115-116).</p>
<h2 id="Inclusion"><a href="#Inclusion" class="headerlink" title="Inclusion"></a>Inclusion</h2><p>The professionals involved in the development process have social responsibilities towards their target public. While the product is being developed, the team should have an awareness of their role. They must think about the purpose of this product, ensuring diversity and inclusion. Over 20% of gamers have some form of disability, and interactive entertainment should improve the quality of life. The technology must help to ensure access to culture and socialization (M2 Communications, 2014).</p>
<p>Thus, the requirements of the project should include other discussions. The representativeness in characters, stories, and scenarios is an important point of inclusion. Also, avoiding prejudice and negative stereotypes.</p>
<p>Besides the content, the development team is responsible for the budget of the project. In places where there are difficulties to study, educational games could give another chance for these students. So, as an important instrument to open knowledge, educational games should be affordable. It is indispensable to ensure access to the people in social vulnerability, reducing the costs of the final product.</p>
<h2 id="Usability"><a href="#Usability" class="headerlink" title="Usability"></a>Usability</h2><p>Usability is the process that makes software usable, paying attention to human limits in memory, perception, and attention. It means anticipating errors and work with the expectations and abilities of the users (Isbister, 2008, p.4).</p>
<p>Designers, programmers, and mostly, marketing professionals use the usability characteristics to improve their products and achieve the ranking of the best sellers. The marketing efforts take advantage of the benefits perceived by the users, instead of the features (Nielsen, 1994, p. 73). Generally, they flood the people with unnecessary advertisements, manipulating the perception, and inflating characteristics of the products. However, the game development process is not just about aesthetics, is about the users’ satisfaction. The final product needs to be useful and the users need to easily achieve their goals. The aesthetical aspects may not interpose and blind the designers to the lack of usability (Norman, 2013, p. 134).</p>
<p>When the companies try to achieve the expectations of the early-adopter users, it is possible that they are excluding a huge parcel of the public. Some people may not meet some requirements like disability, age, geographic location, language, culture, economic situation, or skill. It is evident that it is a design failure. Provide the minimum resources of the product in order to cut costs and focus on aesthetic characteristics is not usability (Keates, 2003, p.51). A design product that takes advantage of the usability process, but does not focus on the accessibility and inclusion is false usability.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Educational games can be a transformation tool, mainly in poor countries, where people have many problems with the quality of education. The games can improve the knowledge giving access for many people who do not have the support of the government, strengthening the community and guaranteeing equality.</p>
<p>The professionals involved in these applications development must face the problems found throughout the process, dealing with the company expectations, and minding the user’s satisfaction.</p>
<p>Apparently, there is a thin border between using usability as a marketing tool, and usability for inclusion. The usability is not about aesthetics or about transforming any product in a best-seller. In fact, a good usability project must include a public portion that sometimes is not considered by the marketing departments.</p>
